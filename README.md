# Probable-octo-happiness

Package for save and show jokes. It is a simple package. Level Db is used in backend. We have used classes with promises.

Example

1. To add joke.

const jf = require('../src/index');

jf.add('Sample joke); 


2. To get a joke.

const jf = require('../src/index');

jf.get(key);
